Description

Enjoy this level set, as the difficulty noticeably increases with a balancing mixture of puzzle and action packed levels!
___








Outdated miscellaneous information

Please report any problems you discover!
v1: 5 10 15 20 and 25 are all bonus levels which will become "actual bonus levels" when adapting to the SVN/1.5 version.  24 is the actual last level
v1: The tar.gz file comes with an automatic installer with source for Linux users.  There is a README with installation instructions for Windows instructions.
___







To upgrade to a later version <=v1.7

Upgrading to a later version will not cause you to lose you're level and replay progress
Manual: Copy the contents of the data directory from the package to the root directory of Neverball and you're finished!
Automatic: Run kki/kki.bin supplied in the package and follow on-screen instructions.  More details:
The Krabby Krap level set comes with an automatic installer with binary and source.  Run the kki/kki.bin supplied in the package.  If you encounter problems, run kkicompile.sh to recompile from the source.  When prompted to Install, Update, or Cancel, input "U" without quotes.  When prompted for the Neverball directory, input "default" or if non-standard input the directory with the trailing '/' truncated.  Please wait patiently for the level set to be installed

Screenshots - outdated v1 - will be updated soon!
